# Health-Insurance-Analysis

Health insurance or medical insurance is an agreement where an insurance company agrees to compensate the insured for the medical and surgical expenses incurred during the policy tenure. The medical expenses may incur if the insured falls ill, or meets an accident that leads to hospitalisation of the insured.
To be eligible to avail coverage benefits under the policy, the policyholder is required to pay a specific amount periodically, known as premium.
Health Insurance premium is decided by an insurance company and policyholders are required to pay the same on a monthly, quarterly, half-yearly, or yearly basis, without any lapse, to avoid losing the renewal benefits.
